        <p>Save'nServe is a foundation dedicated to reducing food waste while fighting hunger in Tunisia. We partner with restaurants, hotels, and food establishments to rescue surplus food that would otherwise go to waste.</p>
        <p>Our mission is simple: collect quality, unused food and distribute it to families and individuals in need across Tunisia's most vulnerable communities.</p>
